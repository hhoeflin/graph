wh 28.01.2005: can we have a "==" function for graphs (e.g. graphNEL)?

sf 24.08.2005: 
    move methods into file named for primary class of dispatch.  For
    example, all methods relating to graphNEL are in graphNEL.R.  This
    follows the organization of the Matrix package.

    document all generics and all classes

    document all methods within classe doc.

    each graph representation class should have its own validation
    function.  This way, adding a new representation doesn't require
    adding another if statement into a monolithic validation routine.

    move methods up into the graph class where possible.
